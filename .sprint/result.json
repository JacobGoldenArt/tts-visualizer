  "notes": "Implemented Spectrogram primitive with all 10 test cases. Key implementation details:\n- Renders frequency bands as vertical/horizontal bars using CanvasRenderer.drawLine() with configurable wobble\n- Bar heights correspond to frequency magnitude (maps dB values -100 to 0 to normalized 0-1 range)\n- Real-time reactivity via update()/render() pattern designed for animation loop integration\n- Accepts ColorPalette from MoodMapper, uses primary color for normal bars, accent for peaks\n- Intensity control (0-1) affects bar count (0.5x to 1.5x base count) and thickness\n- Sketchy rendering via wobble option passed to drawLine (default 0.3)\n- Graceful handling of no audio - shows flat/minimal bars, smooth transition when audio stops\n- Supports horizontal and vertical orientations via setOrientation()\n- Motion control (0-1) affects animation smoothness - uses interpolation for smooth transitions\n- Text/visual mode controls opacity (visual=1.0, text=0.3) via hsla() color format\n- Proper lifecycle with dispose() method to clean up resources",
