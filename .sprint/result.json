  "notes": "Implemented Control Interface feature with React component. Created Controls.tsx with three sliders (saturation, intensity, motion) and mode toggle. Added ControlState types to visual.ts. Implemented getModeStyles utility for text/visual mode styling (opacity, blur, z-index). Added localStorage persistence support with configurable storage key. Supports headless mode for embedding. Added useControlState hook for external state management. All 68 tests pass. Also created setupTests.ts to configure @testing-library/jest-dom matchers for Vitest.",
