  "notes": "Implemented AudioAdapter with full support for PCM, MP3, and WAV formats. Used event emitter pattern with typed events for 'data', 'end', and 'error'. Created comprehensive mocks for Web Audio API (AudioContext, AudioBuffer) since jsdom doesn't support it. All 11 required tests implemented plus additional edge case tests (41 total tests, all passing). Key implementation decisions: (1) Lazy AudioContext initialization for better resource management, (2) Config returns copies to prevent mutation, (3) Graceful handling of empty/null input, (4) Error events distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors, (5) Static factory method for common format configurations.",
