  "notes": "Implemented full CanvasRenderer with Canvas 2D API. Features include: layer compositing (3 stacked canvases for background/midground/foreground), high-DPI support via pixelRatio, sketchy/wobble line drawing, organic blob shapes with Bezier curves, distorted text rendering, animation loop with frame callbacks, and global effects (grain noise overlay, chromatic aberration via RGB channel separation). All 59 tests pass including edge cases for error handling and cleanup.",
