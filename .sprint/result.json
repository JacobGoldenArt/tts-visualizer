  "notes": "Implemented Typography primitive with full keyword particle system. Features include: keyword rendering from semantic pipeline with floating/drifting animation, visual emphasis through size/color/glow effects, text/visual mode support affecting opacity and distortion, configurable font family and base size, fade-in/fade-out lifecycle with configurable duration, boundary collision handling with bounce, motion control for drift speed, intensity control for emphasis strength, user vs AI content differentiation via color (secondary vs primary palette), and mood-based pop/float behavior. The implementation follows the same patterns as the Spectrogram primitive.",
